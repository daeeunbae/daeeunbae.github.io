How does financial development affect economic growth? I revisit this long-standing question in economics by presenting a previously unexplored mechanism in the finance-growth relationship: financial development fosters growth by accelerating the rate at which investment goods improve over time. Empirically, I show that financial development is positively associated with the productivity growth of investment goods production relative to consumption goods production, and that investment goods production relies more heavily on high-R&D industries than consumption goods production. To explain these empirical patterns, I develop a multi-sector R&D-based growth model with financial frictions. In the model, financial development disproportionately enhances the productivity growth of high-R&D industries, as these industries depend heavily on external financing. Since investment goods production is more reliant on high-R&D industries than consumption goods production, it benefits more from financial development. Consequently, investment goods production becomes more efficient, leading to a faster increase in its productivity relative to consumption goods production.
