<b>Abstract:</b> This paper studies the effects of corporate taxes on firmsâ€™ innovation using a sample of publicly traded U.S. firms. First, I find that lower corporate taxes lead to greater innovation activity. Second, this effect is heterogeneous across firm size, as small firms respond more strongly to tax changes. Third, innovations by small firms tend to be more radical, reflected in the higher value of the patents they generate following tax reductions.
